# County-Scraping-APP
County Scraping APP
Developer needs to have VPN to work on this county.
Developer needs to deliver a script that will web scrape both pages from the county:
Appraiser’s web page:
http://propaccess.traviscad.org/clientdb/?cid=1
Tax Collector web page:
https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/properties/taxes/account-search
These 2 links need a single input which is a long number called “Parcel ID”. The Parcel ID is the ID of every single 
property within a county.
The script needs to have the feature of that can be stopped and re-started. So when it restarts, it will ask me the 
question to resume from the beginning or to continue from where it left off.
When it re-starts, it needs to pick up from the next Parcel ID and continue web scraping until the last Parcel ID. 
Once the script is finished, developer will send me 10,000 Parcel IDs to see the output file data and see how the 
script works. Once the output file looks ok, developer can send me the script for me to test it in my computer to 
see how it works. Once it is approved, then developer gets paid
